# TODO: Integrate Privacy Policy Modal

- [ ] Add Bootstrap modal HTML structure containing the full Privacy Policy content before the closing </body> tag in Index.html.
- [ ] Update the Privacy Policy link in the footer to trigger the modal using data-bs-toggle and data-bs-target attributes.
- [ ] Ensure the modal is styled for readability with proper headings, paragraphs, and scrolling if needed.
- [ ] Verify the modal opens correctly when clicked (manual check after implementation).
